/**
 * Booking after hours, and the day a token actually belongs to.
 *
 * A patient who opens the chat at 9pm is not booking for 9pm. The OPD is shut,
 * the doctor is at home, and the only useful token is one for the next sitting.
 * The platform used to answer that in two incompatible ways: the wait estimate
 * knew the cabin was closed, but the token was written with today's date and the
 * message said "leave for the hospital NOW". A day whose token limit was already
 * spent was worse — the booking was refused outright, so the last hour of every
 * evening turned every patient away instead of filling tomorrow morning.
 *
 * Both now go through one function. What is pinned here:
 *
 *   - The day comes from the DOCTOR's own schedule, never a platform-wide guess
 *     about when hospitals open. A doctor with no schedule keeps behaving
 *     exactly as they did before shifts existed.
 *   - A full day is a reason to book the next one, not to refuse.
 *   - Capacity is counted against the day the patient is SEEN. Counting a
 *     next-day booking against today is what filled today's limit with patients
 *     who were never coming today.
 *   - A token booked for tomorrow is still in tomorrow's queue after the
 *     midnight reset. It survived that reset as a record but was dropped from
 *     the queue, so the patient arrived to find themselves in no line at all.
